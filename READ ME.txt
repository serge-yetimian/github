Introduction: 
This project is a simple implementation of a recipe application using the Tkinter library for GUI and CSV data for recipe storage. It allows users to search for recipes, sort results, and view detailed recipe information, including an image and cooking instructions.

Installation
To run the application, ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file using the following command:

bash

To Run the Script, Follow These Steps:
Check if Python is Installed
Open Command Prompt and run:

bash
Copy code
python --version
If not installed, download it from python.org and ensure you add Python to PATH during installation.

Install Required Packages
Run the following commands in Command Prompt:

Install Pillow (for image handling):
bash
Copy code
pip install pillow
Verify Installation
Check if the libraries are installed correctly by running:

bash
Copy code
python
>>> from PIL import Image, ImageTk  # No error means successful installation
>>> import tkinter as tk  # Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python
>>> exit()
Prepare the CSV File and Images

Ensure recipes.csv exists in the scriptâ€™s directory.
Add recipe images as specified in the image_path column of the CSV file.
Run the Script
Navigate to the folder containing your script:

bash
Copy code
cd path\to\your\script
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python your_script.py
